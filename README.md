# Choreographies of planets

Finding stationary solutions of the Newtow equations for the N body problem could be very difficult. However, we can find interesting solutions minimizing the action of the system. 

In _orbits_ is performed a minimization on the action of the system that gives solutions to this problem. A particular  interesting soluions correspond to the case where the trajectories of all the planets is the same. We call this solutions Choreographies. In _choreographies_ there is an implementation for find them.
